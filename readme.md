## Analog Clock

Analog Clock is a great exercise for your javascript skills. So I decided to build one. This project is using Vanilla Javascript DOM Manipulation to allow transitions animation.

> Thing I learned in this project;
  * How to instantiate time with `Date()` and generate interactivity.
  * How to transform elements and add transition based on time events.
  * How to rotate elements `in degrees`. 
  * How to add animations (time and transitions) before and after an event.
